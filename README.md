## Introduction

How square is a positive integer on average?  Let $N$ be a positive integer,
suppose $0<a\leq b$ are positive integers such that $N=ab$ and the difference
$b-a$ is the minimum over all such pairs of numbers whose product is $N$.  If
$N$ is a perfect square then $a=b$; if $N$ is a prime then $b=N$ and $a=1$.
How close to $1$ can we expect the ratio of $a/b$ to be on average.

## A Measurement Function

Neither of the fractions $a/b$ or $b/a$ are very well behaved in an average so
here is another function to measure the "square-ness" of $N$.

Define 
$$
\psi(N)=\frac{\log a}{\log b}
$$
with $a$ and $b$ as in the introduction.  Then when $N$ is prime $\psi(N)=0$
and $\psi(M^2)=1$ for all $M\in Z$.
